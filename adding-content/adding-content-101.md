# Adding Content 101

## Learn Github

This project is managed  inside of Github, and we allow people to open pull requests, and forks of the project to add content they think will fit the site. There are rules about what you can add, and what is acceptable to request to add. Attempting to add content that breaks our rules may result in a rejection of your request.
